    Based on the grading criteria below, evaluate and provide a score for this stock investment on a scale of 0-100. Consider its performance relative to the broader market benchmarks, including the S&P 500's 5-Year Return of 93.01%, 1-Year Return of 25.31%, sector performance, and prevailing market conditions.

    When scoring, account for factors such as:
    - **Sector performance**: How the stock compares within its industry.
    - **Market volatility**: Impact of market-wide risk or stock-specific fluctuations.
    - **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Performance over the investment period compared to the market.

    ### Grading Scale:
    - **0-10**: Severe underperformance, high risk, or poor return relative to safer alternatives.
    - **10-20**: Poor performance, substantial volatility, or consistently low returns.
    - **20-30**: Below-average investment, marginal returns, or stagnant growth.
    - **30-40**: Slight underperformance, moderate growth but lags behind benchmarks.
    - **40-50**: Average performance, in line with S&P 500 or market norms.
    - **50-60**: Slightly above-average performance, moderately exceeding market benchmarks.
    - **60-70**: Strong performance, consistently exceeding market benchmarks by a good margin.
    - **70-80**: Great investment, showing excellent growth and competitive returns.
    - **80-90**: Exceptional performance with low risk and significant outperformance.
    - **90-100**: Outstanding investment, excellent timing, and substantial outperformance.

    ### Provide an exact integer score from 0-100 (not a multiple of 10) and a brief explanation considering:
    - Stock performance relative to its sector and market.
    - Level of risk/volatility experienced during the investment period.
    - Overall return compared to benchmarks and the investmentâ€™s timing.
